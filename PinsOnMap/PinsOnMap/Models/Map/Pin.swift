     The custom initialisation method of the Pin class.

     - The location of the pin. If one of the coordinates is missing then the Pin isn't created and the method returns nil.
     - The life span of the pin based on how many years is the Place opened. Each year counts for 1s to the life span.
     
     - Parameter place: The Place struct which contains necessary information.
     - Parameter openFrom: The date when the Place was first time opened.
